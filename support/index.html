Puravive only needs to be taken for as long as you need, not for life. If you're over 35 years old or carry excess weight, we recommend you take Puravive for at least 3 to 6 months so it has enough time to work throughout your entire body to target your brown adipose tissue levels, reach your desired weight, and lock it in for years into the future. Every 3 bottle package of Puravive comes with the 2 bonus books absolutely free. Or make the smart decision and get the heavily discounted 6 bottle package, which comes with the 2 bonus books absolutely free along with free shipping as well.
